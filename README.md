# Krovi_Tallapragada_qcar_stabilization
## Stabilization of vertical motion of a vehicle on bumpy terrain using deep reinforcement learning

Description : This work was conducted on a scaled autonomous vehicle to minimize the vertical acceleration generated when going over a bump.
This work was published and presented at 2022 Modeling Estimation and Controls Conference, New Jersey.

Participants: Ameya Salvi, John Coleman, Jake Buzhardt, Venkat Krovi, Phanindra Tallapragada
